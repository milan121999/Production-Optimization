# Production-Optimization
This project aimed to optimize the production plan of Shelby Shelving, a manufacturer of grocery store shelves, using Linear Programming (LP). The company produces two models—Model S (standard) and Model LX (heavy-duty)—but faces profitability issues due to cost structures and capacity constraints.

## Introduction 
Shelby Shelving operates under resource limitations and rising costs, with Model S generating a per-unit loss. The need for data-driven operational decisions prompted the use of LP to determine an optimal production mix that would enhance overall profitability.

## Objective
The primary goal was to maximize profit contribution by determining the optimal number of each shelf model to produce. The LP model considered machine hours, assembly line capacities, selling prices, and both variable and fixed costs.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from the textbook Practical Management Science (3rd Edition) and included production capacities, cost details, and time requirements for stamping and forming. It also incorporated constraints such as machine hours (800 per type) and assembly limits for each model.

## Conclusion
The LP model recommended discontinuing Model S (which incurred losses) and focusing entirely on producing 1,400 units of Model LX, leading to a maximum monthly profit of $77,000. Shelby Shelving is advised to reallocate resources and reevaluate Model S's pricing or design in the long term.
